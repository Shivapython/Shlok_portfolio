# Oishi-style Portfolio (React + Vite + Tailwind) — JS edition matching your package.json

This project is a plain JavaScript React starter that matches the package.json you provided (React 19, Vite 7). Files are modular and components are reusable (see `src/components/ui/Button.jsx`).

## How to use
1. Ensure your `package.json` matches what you posted. If not, replace it.
2. Install deps: `npm install`
3. Start dev server: `npm run dev` (open http://localhost:5173)

## Notes
- No TypeScript/test tooling included because your package.json didn't include those dev deps.
- Tailwind is configured; add Tailwind as a dependency if you want to use it in your environment.
- If you want Jest/Vitest tests or TypeScript, tell me and I'll add them using the correct versions.
